# Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

**HTTP** is the most common protocol used for communication between a client (usually a web browser) and a server (web server). HTTP is an **application-layer protocol** that runs on top of TCP/IP.

### HTTP Persistent and Non-Persistent Connections

In the context of **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol), the terms **persistent** and **non-persistent** refer to the way connections between a client (such as a web browser) and a server are managed for multiple requests.

### 1. **Non-Persistent (HTTP/1.0)**

A **non-persistent connection** means that a new TCP connection is established for each HTTP request/response cycle. After the server responds to a client's request, the connection is closed, and a new one is opened for the next request. 

#### Characteristics:
- A new TCP connection is opened for each HTTP request.
- Once the server sends a response, the connection is closed.
- This can be inefficient for loading multiple resources (e.g., HTML, images, CSS files) from the same server, as each file requires a separate TCP connection.
- **HTTP/1.0** initially used non-persistent connections, and they are still used when the `Connection: close` header is sent.

#### Example:
If a web page includes multiple resources like images, scripts, and stylesheets, each of these resources would require a new connection to the server in a non-persistent HTTP connection model.

```text
HTTP Request 1 --> TCP connection opened --> HTTP Response 1 --> TCP connection closed
HTTP Request 2 --> TCP connection opened --> HTTP Response 2 --> TCP connection closed
...
```

#### Disadvantages of Non-Persistent Connections:
- **Increased Latency**: Each request-response pair requires a new TCP handshake, adding time overhead.
- **Resource Intensive**: Multiple TCP connections to the same server can overload the server and client system, leading to inefficient use of resources.

### 2. **Persistent (HTTP/1.1)**

A **persistent connection** (also known as **keep-alive**) allows multiple HTTP requests and responses to be sent over a single TCP connection. The connection is kept open and reused for multiple requests, avoiding the overhead of establishing new connections for each request.

#### Characteristics:
- After the first HTTP request and response, the TCP connection is kept open for further requests.
- The connection remains open until either the client or the server decides to close it.
- **HTTP/1.1** (introduced in 1999) uses persistent connections by default.
- The server can indicate that the connection should be kept open by including the header `Connection: keep-alive` (or simply omitting the `Connection: close` header).

#### Example:
If a web page includes multiple resources like images, scripts, and stylesheets, these can be fetched using the same TCP connection. This is much more efficient than opening a new connection for each resource.

```text
HTTP Request 1 --> TCP connection opened --> HTTP Response 1 --> Connection kept open
HTTP Request 2 --> HTTP Response 2
HTTP Request 3 --> HTTP Response 3
...
```

#### Advantages of Persistent Connections:
- **Reduced Latency**: No need to establish a new TCP connection for each request. This saves time and reduces the overhead of TCP handshakes.
- **More Efficient**: Reusing the same connection for multiple requests reduces resource consumption (both on the client and server sides).
- **Better for Multiple Requests**: Ideal for modern web pages that require fetching many resources (images, scripts, etc.).

#### How Persistent Connections Work:
- After sending the response, the server keeps the connection open unless instructed to close it.
- The client can send additional requests over the same connection without needing to reopen the connection.
- The connection remains open for a period of time (this timeout is controlled by the `keep-alive` header and can vary between different servers).

### 3. **Connection Headers in HTTP**

- **Non-Persistent Connection**: 
  - In **HTTP/1.0**, the connection is closed by default after a response unless explicitly stated otherwise (with `Connection: keep-alive`).
  - In **HTTP/1.1**, a connection is persistent by default unless `Connection: close` is specified.

- **Persistent Connection**: 
  - In **HTTP/1.1**, the connection remains open by default, but it can be explicitly closed by the client or the server using `Connection: close`.
  - `Connection: keep-alive` can be used to keep the connection open for multiple requests and responses.

#### Example of HTTP Headers:
1. **Non-Persistent Connection in HTTP/1.0**:

    ```http
    HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    Connection: close
    ```

2. **Persistent Connection in HTTP/1.1** (default behavior):

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Connection: keep-alive
    ```

### 4. **TCP Connection Overhead in Persistent vs Non-Persistent Connections**

- **Non-Persistent (HTTP/1.0)**: 
  - Every new HTTP request requires a new TCP handshake. This adds overhead in terms of time and resources for every new request.

- **Persistent (HTTP/1.1)**: 
  - Multiple HTTP requests share the same TCP connection, reducing the time spent in establishing new connections. This is particularly useful for loading web pages with many resources (like images, stylesheets, etc.).

---

### 5. **Example of Persistent vs Non-Persistent with Multiple Resources**

- **Non-Persistent Example**:
  If a web page has 5 images, each image requires a separate HTTP request, which opens and closes 5 TCP connections (one for each request).

- **Persistent Example**:
  All 5 images can be requested over the same TCP connection, which reduces the need for establishing new connections and thus improves the performance.

### Key Differences

| Feature                      | Non-Persistent (HTTP/1.0)              | Persistent (HTTP/1.1)               |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| TCP Connection                | Closed after each request-response pair | Connection remains open for multiple requests |
| Efficiency                    | Less efficient, more resource usage   | More efficient, less resource usage |
| Latency                       | Higher (due to multiple handshakes)   | Lower (no need for new handshakes)  |
| Default (HTTP Version)        | Not persistent by default             | Persistent by default               |
| Connection Header             | `Connection: close`                   | `Connection: keep-alive` (or omitted) |

- **Non-persistent connections** are the older approach and are less efficient because each request/response requires a new TCP connection.

- **Persistent connections** improve performance significantly by reusing the same connection for multiple HTTP requests and responses, which reduces latency and resource consumption. This approach is used by default in **HTTP/1.1** and is the preferred method for modern web applications.
