# Security in web communication 

When working with networked applications, it's important to consider the following security aspects:

- **Encryption**: Use SSL/TLS for encrypted communication.

- **Authentication**: Implement authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of clients and servers.

- **Firewalls**: Ensure that necessary ports are open and not blocked by firewalls.

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize input to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
