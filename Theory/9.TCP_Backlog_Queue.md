# TCP Backlog Queue

## What is a backlog?

Backlog is a parameter of the listen function of the socket under Linux . When an application calls the listen system call to put a socket into the LISTEN state, a backlog parameter needs to be specified. This parameter is often described as the length limit of the new connection queue.

Since TCP needs to perform three handshakes to establish a connection, a new connection must go through an intermediate state, SYN RECEIVED, before it reaches the ESTABLISHED state and can be returned to the application by the accept system call. This means that the TCP/IP protocol stack has two different options when implementing the backlog queue:

Only one queue is used, and the queue size is specified by the backlog parameter of the listen system call. When the protocol stack receives a SYN packet, it responds with a SYN/ACK packet and adds the connection to the queue. When the corresponding ACK response packet is received, the connection changes to the ESTABLISHED state and can be returned to the application. This means that the connections in the queue can have two different states: SEND RECEIVED and ESTABLISHED. Only the latter connection can be returned to the application by the accept system call.

Two queues are used - the SYN queue (queue for pending connections) and the accept queue (queue for completed connections). Connections in the SYN RECEIVED state enter the SYN queue, and then move to the accept queue when the state changes to ESTABLISHED (i.e., the last ACK packet in the 3-way handshake is received). As the name implies, the accept system call simply consumes new connections from the accept queue. In this case, the listen system call backlog parameter determines the maximum size of the accept queue.

For Linux operating system, the kernel version after 2.2, the TCP/IP protocol implements the second solution, that is, a syn queue and an accept queue. The length of the syn queue is set at the system level, and the length of the accept queue can be set at the application level. The TCP connection interaction process is shown in the following figure:

 The client uses connect() to initiate a connection request to the server (sends a SYN packet). At this time, the TCP status of the client is SYN_SENT.

After receiving the syn packet, the server puts the TCP related information into the syn queue (semi-connection queue) and sends syn+ack to the client. The TCP status of the server is SYN_RCVD.

After receiving the syn+ack from the server, the client sends an ack to the server. At this time, the TCP status of the client is ESTABLISHED. After receiving the ack confirmation, the server takes the TCP information from the syn queue and puts it in the accept queue (full connection queue). At this time, the TCP status of the server is ESTABLISHED.

After the above three processes, the client and server establish a connection, which is the so-called three-way handshake process.

Therefore, we already know what backlog is, and the origin of semi-connection queue and full-connection queue. The backlog mentioned below refers to the length of the full-connection queue. So how to set the value of backlog?

## How to set up a backlog

The size of the backlog is determined by two factors: the system level and the application level.

System level: somaxconn parameter, which can be set by editing the value of /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn

Application level: For the Netty server, it is set through the option of serverbootstrap, that is, option((ChannelOption.SO_BACKLOG, number), where number is the size to be set and the type is int

The final value of backlog is the minimum of the two, that is, min(backlog,somaxconn). After the service is started, we can view it through ss -tnlp, as shown in the following figure:

In the listen state: Recv-Q indicates the size of the queue that is not accepted by the server application in the backlog; Send-Q indicates the maximum backlog size, that is, the backlog size we set min(backlog,somaxconn). So what setting standards should be referred to when setting the backlog?

## Backlog setting criteria

When setting the backlog, it should not be too large or too small. If it is too large, when the access traffic suddenly increases and exceeds the server load, the client cannot fail quickly, causing the read connection timeout. For the server, it will affect the network I/O, and cause excessive memory usage and increased CPU load. If it is too small, the server's load capacity cannot be fully utilized, and the client will cause connection failure. It should be set based on the maximum qps that the server can withstand. The size of the backlog should be set to about 1-1.5 times the maximum qps that the server can withstand.
