# Socket Programming

It's a way to program a machine (typically called as web server), which serves network request's.

## What is a Socket?

A **Socket** is an endpoint for communication between two machines. It is associated with a specific **IP address** and **port number**. Sockets allow data to be sent and received between computers on a network.

- **Server Socket**: Used by the server to listen for incoming connections from clients.

- **Client Socket**: Used by the client to establish a connection with the server.

## We can use multiple languages to do socket programming but, I'll be doing it in JAVA as of now.

In Java, the `java.net` package provides the `Socket` and `ServerSocket` classes to facilitate socket programming.

In Java, `Socket` and `ServerSocket` classes use TCP as the default protocol for communication. When using TCP sockets:

## Common Socket Methods

Here are some common methods used in Java socket programming:

### `ServerSocket` Methods

- `accept()`: Waits for an incoming connection and returns a `Socket` object.

- `close()`: Closes the `ServerSocket`.

### `Socket` Methods

- `getInputStream()`: Returns an input stream to receive data from the server.

- `getOutputStream()`: Returns an output stream to send data to the server.

- `close()`: Closes the socket connection.

## Flow for the Socket Programming 

- **Connection Establishment**: The client must establish a connection with the server using the serverâ€™s IP address and port.

- **Data Transmission**: Data is sent in a byte stream and is reliable, ensuring the integrity of the data.

- **Connection Termination**: After communication, the socket is closed on both sides (client and server).
